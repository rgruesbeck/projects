### `public record magick`
Script for creating text searchable pdfs from image files.
I wrote this script for a neighborhood group who needed better access public records which were only available to read in the city offices. The workaround was to take digital photographs and use this script to generate pdfs with OCR making a text searchable trove of documents playing a part in the group successfully forcing a developer to build more parking space in a new residential building.
